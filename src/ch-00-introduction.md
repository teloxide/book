# Introduction

This book is a user-guide for the [teloxide](https://github.com/teloxide/teloxide) Rust library.
Teloxide is a full-featured framework that empowers you to easily build Telegram bots using Rust.
It handles all the difficult stuff so you can focus only on your business logic.

This book will guide you through creating and writing your bot with teloxide and teach you how to use different teloxide features.

> Note: teloxide uses [Telegram Bot API] under the hood, if you want to write mtproto-bots, you need a different library.
> For example: [gramme.rs].
